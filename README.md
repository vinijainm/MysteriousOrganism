# Overview
This Project creates a random DNA strand for a new mysterious organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor) - comprised of 15 DNA bases. It
simulate the DNA of P. aequor for the research team to study. It genearates a mutated strand, compares the DNA to its original DNA strand in percentage. 
It also calculate the likelier chance of survival depending on the DNA base.
